client: Notice when the session expires and redirect to /login
        We can't just do this from within the protected route handler
        because it's not called frequently enough. The user could play
        around with a single page past expiry without causing a route
        to change.

        What about having an onExpiry callback from the user model
        that nulls out the user in the app? While we're doing
        time-based things, maybe a callback from the user model saying
        we're getting close to expiry so we can extend it?
